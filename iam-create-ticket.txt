Justification:
The goal is to create automated deployment pipelines from Bitbucket, which are idempotent.
Thus, each environment, dev, cert and prod are built using automated tools, ensuring that the
solution in each environment is correct. This will reduce costs by dramtically reducing errors
and the associated rework. The primary AWS tooling to deploy this is the AWS CDK. This tool is designed
to create highly automated solutions for AWS services. This tooling will be called via BitBucket
CI/CD pipelines, which will require AWS keys and AWS permissions. The above policy will allow
the CDK to function as exepected.

Challenges:
This above policy can create any AWS service, which is likely not in alignment with 
expectations. What can be done is to add boundary permissions, which will cause items 
outside of the boundary to fail. The project needs the ability to create and utilize AWS
roles and services. However, the project does not need to create ALL services. 
What can be defined is the acceptable use of services and then deny access to the other
services. As an example, most commonly used services are S3, step functions, glue, Athena, RedShift, Lambda.
The deployment pipelines should have unfettered access to create and deploy services and roles
for these AWS capabilities.
As an example, services such as EC2, VPCs, gateways, probably should have much stricter limits,
because they do not represent the commonly used services and because they represent higher cost and
security risks.
